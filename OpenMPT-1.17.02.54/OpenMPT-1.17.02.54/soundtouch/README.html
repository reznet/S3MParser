<h2>3. About implementation &amp; Usage tips</h2>
<h3>3.3. About algorithms</h3>
<p><em>Time-stretching </em>means changing
the audio stream duration without affecting it's pitch. SoundTouch
uses WSOLA-like time-stretching routines that operate in the time
domain. Compared to sample rate transposing, time-stretching is a
much heavier operation and also requires a longer processing
"window" of sound samples used by the
processing algorithm, thus increasing the algorithm input/output
latency. Typical i/o latency for the SoundTouch
time-stretch algorithm is around 100 ms.</p>
<h3>3.4 Tuning the algorithm parameters</h3>
<p>The time-stretch algorithm has few
parameters that can be tuned to optimize sound quality for
certain application. The current default parameters have been
chosen by iterative if-then analysis (read: "trial and error")
to obtain best subjective sound quality in pop/rock music
processing, but in applications processing different kind of
sound the default parameter set may result into a sub-optimal
result.</p>
<p>The time-stretch algorithm default
parameter values are set by these #defines in file &quot;TDStretch.h&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>#define DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS     AUTOMATIC
#define DEFAULT_SEEKWINDOW_MS   AUTOMATIC
#define DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MS      12</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These parameters affect to the time-stretch
algorithm as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS</strong>: This is
the default length of a single processing sequence in milliseconds
which determines the how the original sound is chopped in
the time-stretch algorithm. Larger values mean fewer sequences
are used in processing. In principle a larger value sounds better when
slowing down the tempo, but worse when increasing the tempo and vice
versa.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    By default, this setting value is calculated automatically according to
    tempo value.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DEFAULT_SEEKWINDOW_MS</strong>: The seeking window
default length in milliseconds is for the algorithm that seeks the best
possible overlapping location. This determines from how
wide a sample "window" the algorithm can use to find an optimal mixing
location when the sound sequences are to be linked back together.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
The bigger this window setting is, the higher the possibility to find a
better mixing position becomes, but at the same time large values may
cause a "drifting" sound artifact because neighboring sequences can be
chosen at more uneven intervals. If there's a disturbing artifact that
sounds as if a constant frequency was drifting around, try reducing
this setting.<br>
    <br>
    By default, this setting value is calculated automatically according to
    tempo value.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MS</strong>: Overlap
length in milliseconds. When the sound sequences are mixed back
together to form again a continuous sound stream, this parameter
defines how much the ends of the consecutive sequences will overlap with each other.<br>
    <br>
    This shouldn't be that critical parameter. If you reduce the
DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS setting by a large amount, you might wish to try a
smaller value on this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that these parameters can also be
set during execution time with functions "<strong>TDStretch::setParameters()</strong>"
and "<strong>SoundTouch::setSetting()</strong>".</p>
<p>The table below summaries how the
parameters can be adjusted for different applications:</p>

<h2>5. Change History</h2>
<h3>5.1. SoundTouch library Change History </h3>

<p><strong>1.4.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved sound quality by automatic calculation of time stretch algorithm
  processing parameters according to tempo setting</li>
<li>Moved BPM detection routines from SoundStretch application into SoundTouch
  library</li>
<li>Bugfixes: Usage of uninitialied variables, GNU build scripts, compiler errors
  due to 'const' keyword mismatch.</li>
<li>Source code cleanup</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>v1.3.1:
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed static class declaration to GCC 4.x compiler compatible syntax.</li>
<li>Enabled MMX/SSE-optimized routines also for GCC compilers. Earlier
the MMX/SSE-optimized routines were written in compiler-specific inline 
assembler, now these routines are migrated to use compiler intrinsic 
syntax which allows compiling the same MMX/SSE-optimized source code with 
both Visual C++ and GCC compilers. </li>
<li>Set floating point as the default sample format and added switch to 
the GNU configure script for selecting the other sample format.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>v1.3.0:
</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed tempo routine output duration inaccuracy due to rounding
error </li>
  <li>Implemented separate processing routines for integer and
floating arithmetic to allow improvements to floating point routines
(earlier used algorithms mostly optimized for integer arithmetic also
for floating point samples) </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that distorts sound if sample rate changes during the
sound stream </li>
  <li>Fixed a memory leak that appeared in MMX/SSE/3DNow! optimized
routines </li>
  <li>Reduced redundant code pieces in MMX/SSE/3DNow! optimized
routines vs. the standard C routines.</li>
  <li>MMX routine incompatibility with new gcc compiler versions </li>
  <li>Other miscellaneous bug fixes </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.2.1: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added automake/autoconf scripts for GNU
platforms (in courtesy of David Durham)</li>
  <li>Fixed SCALE overflow bug in rate transposer
routine.</li>
  <li>Fixed 64bit address space bugs.</li>
  <li>Created a 'soundtouch' namespace for
SAMPLETYPE definitions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.2.0: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for 32bit floating point sample
data type with SSE/3DNow! optimizations for Win32 platform (SSE/3DNow! optimizations currently not supported in GCC environment)</li>
  <li>Replaced 'make-gcc' script for GNU environment
by master Makefile</li>
  <li>Added time-stretch routine configurability to
SoundTouch main class</li>
  <li>Bugfixes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.1.1: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Moved SoundTouch under lesser GPL license (LGPL). This allows using SoundTouch library in programs that aren't
released under GPL license. </li>
  <li>Changed MMX routine organiation so that MMX optimized routines are now implemented in classes that are derived from
the basic classes having the standard non-mmx routines. </li>
  <li>MMX routines to support gcc version 3. </li>
  <li>Replaced windows makefiles by script using the .dsw files </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.01: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;mmx_gcc.cpp&quot;: Added "using namespace std" and
removed "return 0" from a function with void return value to fix
compiler errors when compiling the library in Solaris environment. </li>
  <li>Moved file &quot;FIFOSampleBuffer.h&quot; to "include"
directory to allow accessing the FIFOSampleBuffer class from external
files. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>v1.0: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial release </li>
</ul>
